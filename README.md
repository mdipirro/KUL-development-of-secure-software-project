# Development of Secure Software Project

This repository contains the project of the course [Development of Secure Software](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H04K5AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp2874384) taught at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/).

This project aimed at gaining expertise in attacking vulnerable software. Small C programs were provided, and the goal was to detect and exploit vulnerabilities. Exploits had to be written in a scripting language and afterwards justified and explained in a report.
